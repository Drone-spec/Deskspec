# DOTFILES

Well here are dotfiles to some of the stuff I enjoy using.

## Tools

These are tools I highly recommend.

flameshot - The HANDS DOWN best screenshot tools.

mdbook - allows you to run markdown notes into a website, combine this with a careful obsidian and you have a powerful combo.

neovim - I love my neovim. I have ditched running a fully custom nvim setup for a more standard astro setup.

kitty - I enjoy this as my main terminal. it comes with some skill issues like other terminals not understanding it but thats just a simple export.

## Desktops

i3 - This has become my fav desktop tool. The ability to toss my mouse out a window and still function has been great!
